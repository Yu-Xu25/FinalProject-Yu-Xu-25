# FinalProject-Yu-Xu-25

## Weather Detector and Outfit Recommendation System 
# Here is what it can do: 
* User Profile Creation: Allow users to input demographic information (name, gender, age, etc.). Include health conditions that might affect their sensitivity to temperature (e.g., allergies, asthma) to tailor recommendations.
Weather Data Integration: Use APIs (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) for reliable weather data. Fetch hourly weather forecasts to provide timely outfit recommendations throughout the day.
* Outfit Recommendations: Develop an algorithm that considers user preferences, current weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind), and their documented wardrobe(optional). Use a scoring system to rank clothing items based on warmth, weather resistance, and user preferences.
* Wardrobe Management: Allow users to input details of their clothing items into a database. Implement a tagging system (e.g., rainy, windy, summer, winter) to categorize clothing items for better recommendations.
* Travel Support: Enable users to input travel destinations and dates, and fetch weather forecasts for those locations. Provide packing lists or outfit suggestions based on the travel destination’s weather.

# To-do list: 
* By the end of week 4, I will have explored web frameworks and made a basic web app that says “hello” 
* By the end of week 5, I will have a basic homepage, and I will have a data model that allows me to add cupcakes, which appear in a list on the homepage.
* By the end of week 6, I will have it so you can click on a cupcake, enter my name, enter a rating for that cupcake, and enter notes about that cupcake.
* By the end of week 7, I will add an “ingredients” section to my cupcakes, and I will be researching how I want to aggregate the ingredients data
* By the end of week 8, I will have the “my preferences” page which ranks which ingredients are my favorites based on how I am rating the cupcakes that contain them. 
* Finally, I will add some messaging to help people use my site, like “Sorry, you have to rate at least 5 cupcakes before we can calculate your preferences”
