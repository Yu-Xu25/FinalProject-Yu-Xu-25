# FinalProject-Yu-Xu-25

# Weather Detector and Outfit Recommendation System 
## Here is what it can do: 
* User Profile Creation: Allow users to input demographic information (name, gender, age, etc.). Include health conditions that might affect their sensitivity to temperature (e.g., allergies, asthma) to tailor recommendations.
Weather Data Integration: Use APIs (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) for reliable weather data. Fetch hourly weather forecasts to provide timely outfit recommendations throughout the day.
* Outfit Recommendations: Develop an algorithm that considers user preferences, current weather conditions (temperature, precipitation, wind), and their documented wardrobe(optional). Use a scoring system to rank clothing items based on warmth, weather resistance, and user preferences.
* Wardrobe Management: Allow users to input details of their clothing items into a database. Implement a tagging system (e.g., rainy, windy, summer, winter) to categorize clothing items for better recommendations.
* Travel Support: Enable users to input travel destinations and dates, and fetch weather forecasts for those locations. Provide packing lists or outfit suggestions based on the travel destination’s weather.

## To-do list: 
example: 
* By the end of week 4, 
    * I will have researched user profile creation. 
    * I will have explored potential APIs for weather data. 
    * I will have explored web frameworks and made a basic web app that says “hello”.
* By the end of week 5, 
    * I will have a basic homepage, and 
    * I will have a basic user registration and login system to allow users to create profiles. 
    * I will have created a database model to store user profiles and preferences.
* By the end of week 6, 
    * I will have integerated the weather API to fetch current weather data based on user location. 
    * I will have basic weather information on the user's home page.
    * I will have developed the outfit recommendation algorithm considering weather conditions and user preferences.
* By the end of week 7, 
    * I will have created a sample wardrobe database to test outfit recommendations.
    * I will implement wardrobe management functionality, allowing users to input their clothing items.
    * Set up a tagging system for clothing items to categorize them (e.g., seasonal, weather type).
* By the end of week 8, 
    * I will have created a user-friendly, modulized and clean interface for displaying current weather, outfit recommendations, wardrope management, and creating packing list (for travel plans).
    * I will have tested basic functionality for each module.
* Finally, 
    * I will have finalized the project by adding documentation, including API endpoints and usage instructions.
    * I will have prepared a presentation showcasing the project’s features and potential for future improvements.
